Endless flying bird game

to make game harder - change the 'gravity scale' to a bigger value which will result in the game object falling faster
this will then allow us to considerably increase the jumping speed as the player now falls faster thus it can jump faster as well

simple yet effective strategy to make a game like flappy bird harder

after every feature was added the game was replayed constantly just so I can double check that there are no existent errors in place
as such I managed to detect a number of errors throughout the process and fix them as I moved along the development process.
