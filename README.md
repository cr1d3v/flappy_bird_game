## About The Project

This is a 'flappy bird' clone game developed from scratch. The game contains new features such as customizable skins, a new world, re-designed score counter, etc. As well as, shares numerous similarities with the original flappy bird game. The game was developed in C# with the help of Unity. 

During the development life cycle the game brought back some great childhood memories. It is truly fascinating how such a simple yet addictive product was created with little to no marketing pushes and managed to strike and become an all-time hit. 

PS: Please note, the 'Leader Board' button is not working, it was a feature that I thought of implementing but didn't get around to finishing yet.
