## About The Project

This is a [Flappy Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird) clone game developed from scratch. The game contains new features such as customizable skins, a new world, re-designed score counter, etc. As well as, shares numerous similarities with the original flappy bird game. The game was developed in [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) with the help of [Unity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)) game engine. 

During the development life cycle the game brought back some great childhood memories. It is truly fascinating how such a simple yet addictive product was created with little to no marketing pushes and managed to strike and become an all-time hit.
